# UNET_ON_MAP_SEGMENTATION_Practice

This project is a practice on UNET frameworks for segmentation tasks with regard to the Legacy of Spatial Apartheid Machine Learning Challenge. The task is about classifying wealthy regions and non wealthy regions as well as non residential paces. The results found are not realy stunning, because the UNET seems to classify between constracted and non-constracted regions on the first practice of this project. Sounds like a failure...........
